# Java and JSP taglib wrapper for Google Chart API #

## Introduction ##
Zebrafish is a Java and JSP taglib wrapper for the Google Chart API. It can easily generate the URL of the Google chart by using Java objects, or create an img HTML tag by using JSP tags.

We hope it could be simple and easy enough so that everyone can use it to build their own charts painlessly. It will support all types of charts.

We are trying to make it could be downloaded **ASAP**.
